# react-hooks-simplified-ts

This follows the React Hooks Simplified course from [here](https://courses.webdevsimplified.com/).

I'm an Angular dev, so I use this type of exercise to... have some remote idea on React.

This does not go 1:1 with the actual course. The differences are due to/as follows:

- the project is set-up with vite
- it uses typescript
- there are dedicated components for each demonstrated hook
- the solutions might differ
- I also used this as an exercise for Copilot capabilities
